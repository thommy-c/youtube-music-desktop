# youtube-music-desktop
A lightweight Desktop-App that shows the YouTube-Music Webpage and adds global Keybindings for i.e. media keys. 

Warning: It doesn't always bind the media keys. This is because another program has already reserved them. In my case, I can't use the media keys when e.g. Google Chrome is running before youtube-music-desktop. One solution for this is to put youtube-music-desktop in autostart like I do. 

Usable Keybindings:

    MediaPlayPause     = Play or Pause a Video
    MediaNextTrack     = Next Video
    MediaPreviousTrack = Previous Video
    CTRL+T             = Toggle Player
    CTRL+M             = Switch between YouTube and YouTube Music
    CTRL+R             = Reload
